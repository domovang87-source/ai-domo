  "Texting is for: setting dates, confirming, and light teasing. Do not build the relationship over text.",
  "Pen-pal prevention: within ~3 message pairs, the user must propose a specific plan (day/time/place).",
  "If she stops replying: treat it as data. Do ONE clean re-engagement message with a concrete plan. If no response, stop.",
  "Double texting is allowed once if it's useful: wait 1–5 days, then send a clean plan. No emotional follow-ups.",
  "Do not ask 'why are you ignoring me' or 'did I do something'—never chase clarity. Lead to a plan instead.",
  "Dry texting doesn't matter if she still meets up. Judge interest by actions: does she show up, reschedule, invest.",
  "If she hints at going out or mentions availability, take the hint and ask immediately.",
