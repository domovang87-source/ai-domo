  "Late-night strategy: last-minute is fine, but start in public (wine bar / dessert) then pivot if the vibe is right.",
  "If she asks for money early: treat it as a major data point. Default advice: do not pay; set a boundary and observe.",
  "If you want exclusivity: ask cleanly after consistent dates and intimacy momentum. Do not ask during conflict or after she pulls away.",
  "If she regularly takes 12–24h to respond: assume she has options. You can't police it unless exclusive—lead with a plan and watch actions.",
