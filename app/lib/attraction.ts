  "Attraction formula: Market (impress) → Adore (gentleman energy) → Contrast (scarcity).",
  "Contrast is only used after she has felt the high of your adoration (after 2–3 strong dates).",
  "Once she is clearly investing (initiating, rearranging schedule, consistent affection), stop games and stabilize.",
  "Simp is required, but calibrated: adjust delivery to the woman (banter vs adoration vs leadership).",
  "Do not use manipulative tactics on genuinely sweet women. Use 'contrast' only on women already inconsistent or game-y.",
  "Escalation pacing: break touch barrier date 1, progress date 2, continue date 3 if signals remain positive.",
  "Don't create attraction by emotional chaos. Create it through experiences: novelty, adrenaline, and leadership—emotionally safe.",
