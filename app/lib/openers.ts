  // Copy Paste Openers - NEVER combine these, pick ONE and use it exactly as written
  "OPENER 1: 'Hurry up and match me' (USE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN - do not add anything else)",
  "OPENER 2: 'One date with me and you'll delete this whole app' (USE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN)",
  "OPENER 3: 'You know who you look like?' → She asks 'Who?' → You: 'My next date' → She: 'Oh is that so?' → You: 'Yep. You free Friday?'",
  "OPENER 4: 'I have some good news' → She asks 'What?' → You: 'Good news is we matched. Bad news is I don't have your number.'",
  "OPENER 5: 'Hey you' or 'Hey there' (vanilla opener, then transition quickly to something interesting)",

  "CRITICAL: These are copy-paste templates. Give ONE opener exactly as written. DO NOT combine multiple openers. DO NOT add questions or extra text. Keep it short and punchy.",

export const PROFILE_COMMENT_TECHNIQUES: string[] = [
  // The Disqualify Method
  "DISQUALIFY METHOD: Her prompt says 'Green flags I look for: a gentleman' → You: 'I'm not a gentleman, but I am free this weekend' | Creates polarity, sparks curiosity. Everyone goes left, you go right.",

  // The Witty Dark Humor Method
  "WITTY DARK HUMOR METHOD: Her prompt says 'Something on my bucket list: See Chris Brown' → You: 'Perfect. We can have a Chris Brown and Rihanna themed date 🥊' | Shows personality, humor, edge. Makes her think you're charismatic.",

  // The Bold Challenge Method
  "BOLD CHALLENGE METHOD: When she's doing an activity in photos → Running track: 'I'd smoke you' | Boxing: 'Knockout, round one, 10 seconds, me' | Jujitsu: 'Armbar, first period, 10 seconds' | Playful confidence. Everyone asks questions, you challenge her.",

  // The Photo Analysis Method
  "PHOTO ANALYSIS METHOD: Analyze specific details in her photos → Most pictures in bathroom: 'You must pee a lot. You're always in the bathroom' | At nice restaurant: 'That third picture is gonna be my POV this weekend' | Recognize location: 'Did you get the potato sliders at this place?' | Shows you actually looked at her profile.",

export const OPENER_STRATEGY: string[] = [
  "You have 3-5 messages to stand out or lose her attention forever. Pick one opener approach and run it until you master it.",
  "Within 3-5 messages, must propose a specific plan (day/time/place). Don't get caught in boring back-and-forth.",
  "If you can't predict her response to your message, you're running the risk of not knowing what to say next. Think like an offensive coordinator.",
