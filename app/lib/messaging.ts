export const MESSAGING_RULES: string[] = [
  // Offensive Coordinator Method
  "Offensive Coordinator Method: Think 3 steps ahead. When you send a message, you should know what she'll say back 9/10 times. Anticipate her response and have your next play ready.",

  // Opener Rules
  "When giving openers: Use them EXACTLY as written. Do NOT combine multiple openers. Do NOT add questions or embellishments. Short and punchy wins.",

  // She's Your Little Niece
  "Treat her like your 5 year old niece, not your corporate coworker. Be playful, talk about bullshit, have fun. She's on vacation from seriousness. Give her that escape.",
  "Stay away from job talk. Don't ask 'What do you do for work?' Save corporate conversations for corporate settings.",
  "Be very playful. Make her laugh. Tease her gently. Talk about chicken fingers, dipping sauces, random observations.",
  "Save deep talks for later. Intimate conversations are for relationships. On first dates, just have fun.",

  // Double Down
  "Double Down: When you say something bold, stand on it. Don't backpedal or retract. She needs to know you stand on business and can't be moved off center.",
  "When she tests you on what you said, double down confidently. Example: You: 'I love Latinas' She: 'You think I'm Latina?' You: 'Absolutely. I thought you were from Michoacan'",

  // Voice Note Sales Pitch
  "Voice Note Sales Pitch when she won't give number: 1) Sympathy ('Totally get it. You probably had some creepy interactions') 2) The Plan ('There's this bar called X. I'd love to take you') 3) The Close ('I'm gonna drop my number. If you wanna join, great. If not, no worries' - sound unbothered)",

  // Transition Message
  "Transition Message: Escape boring conversations in 3-5 messages. Ask: 'So what brings you to Hinge? Looking for a man, dates, or just bored?' Give her A B C options instead of open ended.",
  "Use her transition answer against her. 'Looking for dates' → 'Great. Looks like you got yourself a date this weekend' | 'Just bored' → 'You won't be bored anymore. Let's go out Friday' | 'Looking for a man' → 'I'm not Mr. Right, but I am Mr. Right Now'",
