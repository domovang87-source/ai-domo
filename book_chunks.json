    "content": "The Domo Theory\nHow to Actually Win With Women in Modern Dating\nIntroduction\nHello,\nMy name is Domo Vang, and I am now your dating coach. In this guidebook, you are going to find the frameworks I have tried and tested throughout my life in dating. I’ve gained experience through personal stories, friend’s perspectives, and personal in-depth research.\nI began giving advice about dating on TikTok, where I would simply share thoughts and stories. Over time, men (and women) have resonated with the advice, noting that they felt guidance and help in our ever changing modern world. I know there is so much information out there, so I wanted to give men the real truth about what women think, feel, and what we ACTUALLY respond best to. I want to make dating easier for men, and also better for women. I will share different tactics and methods you can use in dating in order to be more successful, and I hope you can leave feeling more confident and in charge of your dating life (because you deserve it, king).",

She decides “yes/no” on your face and energy before she reads your funny one-liner.\nIf your photos suck, nothing else matters. If you don’t have good photos, ask a female friend, a sibling, or book a cheap photoshoot. This is your sales page. (Female friends, or female family members will take better photos than an average male friend). Tell her that you want her to get your good angles. She will know what looks good to the “feminine eye/gaze” if you tell her to focus on that. Use that phrase.",

Be friendly with:\nHer friends\nThe bartender\nThe security\nThe promoter\nYou’re building a network. Being friends with more people will introduce you to more hot women!!!\nAt the Gym\nGym is high-risk/high-reward.

No hovering over her like a hawk.I personally can always sense when a man is staring at me. I would honestly prefer if he just comes up to me and says hello instead of making me feel like a piece of meat. Just approach like another person!\nPro Tip:Be friendly with the gym staff first. When everyone knows you and you feel “safe” in that space, women see you as more approachable and may want to be your friend so that she can have more friends in the gym. Gym people are a bit solitary, so some women do secretly want friends. Also, when you are friends with people at the gym, your open energy will communicate.\nThe One Question That Instantly Ruins It\nIf you’re approaching a woman out of nowhere in public, please never ask:\n“Do you live alone?”\nThis is an instant “ick” and safety flag.\nIf we just met and you’re asking whether I live alone, my brain goes straight to:\n“Are you planning a crime or what?”\nJust don’t. Unless she’s all over you, clearly flirting, clearly aiming for something that night, don’t ask the question. It’s better to beat around the bush with a question like, “Do you have roommates?” if you want to know.",

You have to realize that in today’s climate, women work just as hard as men, are busy, take care of themselves, and have their own lives.\nWhat we need is polarity — a man who makes us feel soft, led, and gentle. The least you can do is put in effort to court her.

I’ll bring him his favorite treats, remember every word he says, and want to pour into him.\nBut even bigger than her adoring you, the reason you should do these things is because you. are. a. man.\nYou are not a woman — you are the strong, steadfast man.

He opened with something light about my Halloween costume, then asked me out.\nDate Spot: Macondray in SF.\nHe had this quiet, humble energy that fit his bigger frame.\n✅ What He Did Right\nPaid for drinks and dinner.\nOffered to buy eye drops at Walgreens afterward (my eyes were dry).\nGave provider, thoughtful energy.\n❌ What Could Be Better\nHe kept walking slightly ahead of me instead of beside me.\nMentioned seeing each other again a lot early on, which felt a little performative.\n🎯 Result\nI said yes to a second date.

He made a reservation at a nice Italian restaurant.\n✨ Good Moments (Micro-Actions)\nWhen the hostess asked \"Inside or outside?\" and I hesitated, he decided: “It’s beautiful outside, let’s sit on the patio.”\nMoved the velvet rope blocking my seat instead of letting me struggle.\nPulled the table out so I could sit comfortably.\nCut the bread when he saw me struggling.\nPlated my food for me.\nHe didn’t spend extra money. He just acted like a man.\n💡 Lesson\nWe love feeling taken care of. It’s the micro-actions.\n3. Bar Hopping Success (Then Failure)\nContext: Tinder.\nHis Opening: “Are you more of a parks and picnic girl, a café and wandering girl, or a food and dessert girl? I’m planning our second date.” (I ignored him for 2 months.)\nHis Follow-up: “What are your favorite spots? I need to know where NOT to take you.” (That got my attention.

He stood close, looked down at me, pulled me in by the waist, paused, then kissed me.

He kept initiating and pursuing dates with me via text. I agreed. But, in person, he was aloof, and would keep hanging out with me without chasing hard. Suddenly, I was the one chasing him.\n💡 Lesson\nConfidence plus calmly owning your attraction changes how we see you.\nThe Affirmation: Look in the mirror before your date and literally tell yourself: “I am sexy.

It will make her run after you.\n⚠️ A Word of Warning (From Your Coach)\nUse this formula to create attraction, not to destroy her.\nIf you successfully get her and she falls in love, she will remember everything you did.\nDon't cross the line. If you take the manipulation too far, she will eventually realize the game, resent you, and play you right back (and potentially harder).\nThe goal is to make her obsessed with you, not traumatized.\nCase Study: How a Guy Got Me Obsessed — And Then Lost Me\nThis is embarrassing, but it’s instructive.\nI was seeing a guy who had me genuinely obsessed. Here’s exactly how he played it:\n1. He gave mixed signals\nHe barely texted back — short, dry replies. Almost zero reassurance.\n2. But he marketed himself perfectly\nHe showed me the exact attributes I’m drawn to. Literally my type to a T:\nlooks\nfamily\ncareer\nlifestyle\nemotional tone\nHe was perfection with no flaws.\n3.

No. It can be:\nThigh touch\nHand hold\nHug\nKiss on the cheek\nExceptions:\nVery conservative cultures\nVery young / inexperienced women\nStrong religious norms\nBut default: do something. ANYTHING to create some physical tension.\n“Are bar dates okay?”\nYes — if the bar is actually nice or interesting.\n“Wanna get a drink at some random dive near my place?” Can sound lazy.\n“There’s this speakeasy I love — they have insane cocktails, we should check it out Thursday. Are you available?” Sounds intentional.\n“What about splitting on date 2 or 3?”\nDate 1: you pay.\nDates 2–3: ideally you still pay, but you can start planning cheaper, more creative dates if money is tight.\nBy date 3, you can take her to more casual dates like the park, walks, seeing the sunset, etc.\n“Can I exaggerate my height?”\nYes, within reason. Everyone inflates a little.\nIf she’s 5’9 and you say you’re 6’0 but you’re actually 5’8 and she shows up in heels towering over you, that’s rough.\nIf you’re 5’9 and you say 5’10?
